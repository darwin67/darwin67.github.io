      <description>My name is Darwin D. Wu and I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer based in San Francisco.
I&amp;rsquo;m a self-taught engineer, graduated with a Political Science/Economics degree but have felt in love with software engineering since my senior year and have made the jump into this world.
I&amp;rsquo;m more focus as a SRE but can also do general application development. Interested in all kinds of technologies, especially operating systems, compilers and the lower level stuff.</description>
