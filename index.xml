      <description>My name is Darwin D. Wu and I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer based in San Francisco.
I&amp;rsquo;m a self-taught engineer, graduated with a Political Science/Economics degree but have felt in love with software engineering since my senior year and have made the jump into this world.
I&amp;rsquo;m mostly what people call a Full-Stack engineer and DevOps/SRE, but currently more focus on the backend and ops side these days. Interested in all kinds of technologies, especially operating systems, compilers and the lower level stuff.</description>
